### Hi there!

I am an applied maths graduate & a computer science student who is mostly interested in Software Development and Cloud Computing. Currently, I am working as a software developer in a fast-paced fintech company. I mainly work on financial calculations with Python, build and handle a React project with Material UI, manage microservices with Spring Boot and prepare infrastructure with AWS. My goal is to increase my capabilities in Software Architecture & Development, DevOps and Cloud Computing.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me via my Linkedin profile or my email (alarackck [at] gmail [dot] com).
