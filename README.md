### Hi there!

I am an applied maths graduate & a computer science student who is mostly interested in Software Development and Cloud Computing. At the moment, I am working as a software developer in a fast-paced fintech company. I mainly work on financial calculations with Python, building of a React project with Material UI, managing microservices with Spring Boot and prepare infrastructure with AWS. My goal is to increase my capabilities in Backend Development, DevOps and Cloud Computing.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me via my Linkedin profile or my email (alarackck [at] gmail [dot] com).
