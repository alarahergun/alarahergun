### Hi there!

I am a newly graduated university student from mathematical engineering who is pursuing a double major in computer engineering in Turkey, Yildiz Technical University. I am mostly interested in Software Development and Cloud Computing and at the moment, I am working as a part time software developer in a team focused on Microservices and Cloud Computing. My goals are to increase my capabilities in Backend Development, DevOps technologies and principles and Cloud Computing.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me via my Linkedin profile or my email (alarackck [at] gmail [dot] com).
