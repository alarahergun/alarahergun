### Hi there!

I am an applied maths & computer science double major who is mostly interested in Software Development and Cloud Computing. At the moment, I am working as a part time software developer in a team focused on Microservices, Cloud Native architecture and Cloud Computing. My goal is to increase my capabilities in Backend Development, DevOps and Cloud Computing.
