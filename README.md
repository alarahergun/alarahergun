### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a senior university student currently studying mathematical engineering and doing a double major with computer engineering in Turkey, Yildiz Technical University. I am mostly interested in Software Development & AI-related studies. At the moment, I am working as a part time software developer which is working on cloud computing. My goals are to increase my capabilities in Backend and Front End Development and learn DevOps technologies and principles.

If you want to reach me, you can contact me via my Linkedin profile or my email (alarackck [at] gmail [dot] com).
