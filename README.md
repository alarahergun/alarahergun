### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a Turkish student currently studying mathematical engineering and doing a double major with computer engineering in Turkey, Yildiz Technical University. I am mostly interested in machine learning and data analysis but I am also trying to learn basic knowledge about many fields in computer science. 

If you want to reach me, you can contact me by my Linkedin profile or my email (alarackck@gmail.com).
